# Python for Advanced Web Apps
 
Read the documention: [Python Beginners](https://python-adv-web-apps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

This repo is being built out in spring 2020. It's based on [an earlier repo](https://github.com/macloo/python-beginners).

In this new repo I'm using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/intro.html) and [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) *for the first time* (so that's a journey in itself) to build a text for journalism students learning Python.

We are using [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) (second edition) as our textbook and main resource for learning Python from zero. Therefore, this repo does not attempt to teach Python *basics* &mdash; although it does include some basic scripts.

Code for the course is all in the `/python_code_examples` folder.

The main reason for the docs is that the course covers:

1. Introduction to Python
2. Web scraping with Beautiful Soup and some Selenium
3. Flask for building data-driven web apps

I've used books in the past for teaching parts 2 and 3 (notably [Web Scraping with Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920078067.do) and [Flask Web Development](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920089056.do)), but this year I've cut back to just the one book.

Rather than try to reconfigure the previous repo, I'm starting from scratch here and building the new repo with an emphasis on the docs.

For the scraping and Flask segments of the course, the docs will be the primary instructional resource.
